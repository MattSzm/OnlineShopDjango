# OnlineShopDjango

This is my personal project, which presents a clothing shop.

## I've created it with:
* Python[[Django]][djangolink]
* HTML
* CSS
* (a little bit of JavaScript, just to create braintree payment process)

This is ready-to-work page.

All required additional extensions can be found in 'InstalledThirdParty.txt'

Whole app is working with Postgres database.
However, I didn't attach data to the repository. You can add your own in django admin panel.


## The project has such features as:
- [x] Creating user accounts along with the history of their orders.
- [x] Customers can download a dynamically generated invoice for each paid order.
- [x] E-mail notifications about new orders / account registrations.
- [x] Recommendations based off of previously viewed products.
- [x] Fully working payment system which supports credit cards.
- [x] A search engine that uses product names and descriptions, can also find a brand.
- [x] Using 'thumbnail' to cache product and brand images.
- [x] Notification system (django messages).
- [x] Registration system prohibiting creation of several accounts to one e-mail address(Own user model and user manager).
- [x] Subpages with particular brands.
- [x] Ability to choose different sizes.
- [x] Using class Views.

Although I focused on presenting my 'backend' skills during work on this project, I also tried to make my page a responsive one.
